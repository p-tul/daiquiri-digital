I'll keep this brief. Every venue needs a website.

Okay. Maybe that is too brief.

However, I will make the case for why it's so important to have a dedicated website rather than relying on social media pages or, god forbid, auto generated pages.

## Argument against Social Media Pages

Social media is great, in its own special, needy, pain in the ass kind of way. And it is important for all sorts of businesses to have a quality presence on these platforms.

The analogy I like to use is that it's like having a housemate who's not on the lease. Thing can seem fine and there may never be a problem. But there is technically no control and if they decide to leave you in the shit, there is nothing whatsoever you can do.

Let me explain. If you have a Facebook page, you are given **permission** by Facebook to create a profile, add photos and write posts. You can connect with customers and publish ads. But what most people don't get is that Facebook owns all of this. If they decide to revoke that privilege, or start charging you, they can. And there's precisely fuck all you can do about it.

So what would happen to your business if your only real outlet of marketing decides to close it's doors?

Same with Instagram. Whilst it hasn't happened to our industry, not long ago Instagram decided to make a small change to the way posts were displayed which ended up decimate the income of Influencers who relied on that feature to justify their fees.

Another point is that your business might have 10 000 followers but if that platform changes, what do you have? Do you still have the contact details of those 10 000 people? No.

## My Not Too Biased Opinion on Websites

Now I realise that it is in my interest to convince people to pay for a website. However, I wouldn't be doing this if there wasn't a genuine need for those sorts of services.

There are a number of reasons that I think it's so important for venues to have a dedicated website and I'd like to touch on a few.

#### You own the content

Everything on your site belongs to you. Unless you stole it from someone else. Trademark laws are pretty fuzzy when it comes to social media and it's not uncommon to find profiles promoting your content under their name.

#### You control the content

More importantly, you can put anything you like on your site. Menus, image galleries, testimonials. You could build a little game that asks guests a few questions and then recommends a cocktail from the menu. (Yes I did just think of that and yes, that is an awesome idea)

The beuty is, if you can think of it, someone can build it. Facebook doesn't do that.

#### Your audience is engaged

It's all well and good for a post to reach 500 people but if none of them are going to come to your venue, there's not much point. It is however much more likely that someone visiting your website is going to walk through your doors or make a booking.

#### You can build a mailing list

Unlike the contacts and followers on social media, if someone signs up to your mailing list, there are two benefits. One, they are genuinely interested in what you do And two, you own that mailing list. No Silicon Valley executive can take it away from you.

#### No one can fuck with it

Going back to the Silicon Valley exec thing. No one owns the internet so no one can mess with your site. Even if your hosting company goes under or their servers explode, you can just move the file onto a new host and you're back in business.

## Not a Hater

I'm not trying to shit on social media. It really is a remarkable resource and a very affordable one at that. But there is no guarantee that it will always be free and putting so much of your business in the hands of tech giants just can't be a good idea.

My advise, build an amazing social presence and then build a kick ass website (cough cough) and make them work together.

##### *A note on auto-generated websites.

Companies like Google and GoDaddy both offer a sort of computer generated website based on some input about company details. A Google profile is hugely important but under no circumstances should you use this site generator. They aren't geared towards hospitality at all and have a big ugly "Get A Quote" button at the top.

These companies offer some very impressive services and tech but for the time being, this just isn't one of them.

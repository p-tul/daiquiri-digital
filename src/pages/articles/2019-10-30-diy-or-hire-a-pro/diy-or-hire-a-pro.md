With more and more of our customers heads buried in their phones, having a strong digital presence is becoming a necessity for hospitality business of all sizes. The problem is, our experience lends to making a perfect daiquiri or remembering a table of 12s order, not design websites.

Depending on your patience, technical skills and budget, there are a few options. You can DIY by using a website builder or you can hire a professional web developer. Either way, as I’ve said before:

> **Going DIY is ALWAYS better than having no website at all.**

## What You Need to Start

Before you pick an online platform or put the feelers out for developer, you'll need to have a few things locked away.

- Domain
- Hosting
- Logos & Branding
- Business Details


### Domain

Usually, whenever I start an new business, (or let’s be honest, when I come up with a business idea that may or may not be followed through) I check to see if the name is registered with the governing body and I check if the domain is available. If they both are, I purchase both at the same time.

What's a domain? Very simply, it’s your website address. e.g. your-business-name.com.au. It is from here that you can also set up email addresses like info@your-business-name.com.au.

Now, if you have a bar or cafe and never bought the domain, don't fear. Thanks to the invention of TLDs (top level domains) e.g. .com, .com.au, .net etc. the chances are you'll still be able to find an appropriate domain.

If you are hiring a developer, you can get them to purchase and set up your domain for you. If you are doing it yourself, it's really not too difficult and I'll link to some useful articles at the bottom.


### Hosting

Hosting is another of the more technical aspects of a website. Basically, a host or hosting company is a company that owns a server (which is just a big ass computer in a big ass data centre that 'hosts' the files of your website) and then sends those files to an individual’s computer when they visit your site.

Depending which route you go down, you may have to sort this out separately but often it can be bundled with your domain registration. A lot of site builders also offer to provide this service for an additional fee.


### Logos & Branding

If you've already had a designer do your logos and branding, make sure you get them to provide you with the working files as well as hi-res versions in .png and .jpeg formats.

If you are starting from scratch, however, talk to your developer. Some can provide design services themselves and if not, they will definitely be able to connect you with the right person. Same goes for photography.

e.g. I personally don't do logo design, but I offer it to clients by bundling it into a package and sub-contracting a trusted designer.


### Business Details

If you are doing it yourself, then you will likely already know most of this stuff off the top of your head. However, if you're working with a developer, make sure you spell this out clearly right from the start.

##### Some but not all include:

- Address (as well as the preferred entrance)
- Opening Hours
- Contact Number
- Contact Email
- Booking Policy
- Function Areas
- Menus
- Social Media Pages

## Website Builders

Website builders are kind of like online programs that give you a nice user interface to build your site (actually, that's exactly what they are). It allows non-technical people to build attractive sites without having to know any code.

The downside to website builders is that a lot of websites often end up looking extremely similar. I've opened several venues and the branding, look and feel were so important, the idea of a site that looked like one of my competitors is a missed opportunity to stand out from the crowd.

Pricing is typically charged monthly or yearly and includes everything you need to get up and running. Premium themes and plugins will cost you extra.

Most website builders will give you the option to purchase a domain through them and they will also take care of hosting. The domain purchase is often free for the first year and the hosting is incorporated into their monthly/yearly fee.

There is an almost endless list but the below are the top 3 platforms that I'd recommend.
    
### [Squarespace](www.squarespace.com)

Squarespace has made a pretty big name for itself in the last few years for having a combination of an easy to use interface and really beautiful templates.

Their sign up process is very easy and they can help you with domain and hosting process.

### [Wordpress]()

As all Wordpress fans will tell you, Wordpress powers something like 25% of the internet. Its biggest pro is also its biggest con. It's hugely customiseable with plugins and themes. There is pretty much no limit to what you can build with Wordpress if you have the time.

Unfortunately, this can mean a bit of a steep learning curve for non-technical people and can get pretty messy if not properly managed. I'm certainly not saying don't use Wordpress. Simply that for the purposes of most hospitality business, it isn't the simplest option.

It's worth noting that you don't technically pay for Wordpress. You simply need a domain and hosting and you can install it for free onto your server. Most hosts have a very straight forward process for this. You simply pay for some premium themes and plugins.

### [Wix](http://wixstats.com/?a=30979&c=124&s1=daiquiri-digital)

Similar to Sqaurespace, Wix has carved out a bit of market share by being simple to use and featuring attractive templates. In my experience, it doesn't quite have as much flexibility as Squarespace but that might have something to do with my desire to customise everything.

## Designer / Developer
First things first, these are technically two different roles. A designer does just that. They design what the website will look like. It's layout, colour palette, font types etc. A developer translates those designs into code that your internet browser can interpret and display.

If you are hiring a freelancer or agency, they might do both jobs or split the work between a couple of people. Obviously, the more people involved, the higher the cost.

The benefit of hiring a professional is that your site will directly reflect your brand and it's look and feel. You aren't restricted in what you can do or which 3rd party applications you can incorporate and it takes the stress away from you or your team to produce a beautiful product.

A developer will typically charge upwards of $1000 for a complete site including design, hosting for the first year or 2 and several reviews. Further integrations or features might cost a little more depending on how involved they are.

It's worth noting that is also quite common to go with a mixture of the two. I've had several clients ask me to build them a Squarespace site. This means that I can add custom code and squeeze a bit more flexibility from the system but if they want to change something in the future, they can do so on their own.

## Conclusion

The route you go down will depend largely on your budget and specific needs. It could be argued that a small local bar doesn't need a custom built site whilst a restaurant chain probably does.

Like most things in this world, you get what you pay for.

If your a small venue, just starting out, I'd probably recommend doing something simple and elegant yourself until you grow to the point that you can justify moving to the next level. Just remember that a developer isn't going to just help you build a website but can often set up SEO, email marketing and all sorts of other useful tools (I'll write an article on this soon).

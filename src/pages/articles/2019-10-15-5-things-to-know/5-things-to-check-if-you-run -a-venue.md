# 5 Digital Must-Haves If You Run A Venue 
 
Running a venue is a tough job and managers often find themselves wearing more than one hat. If you want to give your business a digital health check, I've put together a list of essentials that you should check to make sure your online presence is as good as your drinks/service.

## Website

By far the most important part of your online footprint should be your website. It allows you to grab your guest’s attention and sell them on the story of your brand before they step foot in your venue.  With platforms like [WIX](http://wixstats.com/?a=30979&c=124&s1=daiquiri-digital) now available, even someone with no design or coding experience can put together an impactful website. There are limitations to these tools as I've discussed in another article, but if your choice is between doing it yourself and not having a website, do it yourself!

Your website doesn't need to be complex; we're not building Facebook. It simply needs to reflect your venue’s brand identity, showcase the offering and provide the essential info. Some things to include are:

###### Opening Hours

Please, for the love of god put this on the home page, if not every page. It is without a doubt the main piece of information a guest is looking for when they come to your site. Google has gotten pretty good at providing this, but it also helps to have it clearly on your website.

###### Menu

This can be a bit tricky for some venues who change their menu frequently but it's worth the effort to keep it up to date. The second biggest reason someone is coming to your venue, after wanting to hang out with you of course, is to eat and drink. At the very least have a link to a PDF version of your menu or if you are feeling fancy, make it a part of the web page.

###### Imagery

The biggest piece of advice I can give when it comes to imagery is quality over quantity. If the photo isn't great or it's fuzzy, it will do more harm than good by making your brand look unpolished and unprofessional. Three or four beautiful, cohesive shots is enough to tell your brand story.

###### Location Map

Whilst this isn't essential, it's a nice feature especially for mobile users. Integrating Google maps allows your guest to set a pin for your venue on their phone and guide them straight to your door. No more leaving cookie crumbs on the footpath.

###### Promotions

Happy Hour, $10 Steak Night or Grand Final Party. Whatever it is, make sure you feature them prominently on your home page. Just putting these up on social media is fine but you'll reach a much more engaged audience if you keep your website up to date.

## Email List
Email marketing has proven to be one of the most effective forms of marketing.  It allows you a direct line to those who have already expressed an interest into your venue.  Using a pop-up on your website that prompts users to sign up your mailing list (with the promise of a birthday bonus or similar) will have your mailing list growing steadily in no time.

If you have a mailing list, then use it! There is no point going to the effort of collecting these email addresses if you don't bother using them.  Social media is great for connecting, but remember, Facebook owns those connections, and they may not always give it away for free.  You own your mailing list and have complete control.

I highly recommend using a service such as MailChimp to manage the whole process for you. No need to get spammy, just an informative email once a quarter to inform guests on any changes or special events you have coming up.

## Google Profile
The all-powerful Google plays a big part of our lives and is hugely important when it comes to directing new customers to your bar. Your venue’s Google profile is what shows up on the right side of the screen when you search for it. Google makes it pretty easy to set up your business profile and I've written in more detail about it here. The main things to get right are:

##### Location

As I said earlier, having a map to your venue is unbelievably helpful. Thankfully, Google does this automatically for you. If your venue is tucked away, and a little hard to locate, you can go in and move the marker.

##### Operating Hours

I can't stress enough how important this is. Keep these up-to-date and stick to them. There is nothing more annoying than turning up to a venue that Google says is open and it's not.  Alternatively, imagine how many customers you may lose if Google says you’re closed when you’re not.

##### Contact Details

A phone number and a website are all you really need. You'll be surprised at how much traffic you get via the website link -which Google will tell you every month. Depending what country you are located, consider having WhatsApp set up for the venue too.  This makes it infinitely easier to attract guests who may not be able to make local calls.

##### Public Holidays 

If you are going to be open on Easter or closed on Christmas, try and get this updated as early as possible so you don't lose out on potential bookings.

##### Images

There are two sections for images here. One uploaded by users and the other uploaded by owner. Choose a couple of nice shots of the interior, the food and drink and one of the entrance. It will help guests find where they need to go.

##### Reviews

A lot of people have mixed feelings about online reviews. Regardless of what yours are, they exist and don't look like they're going anywhere. Google allows users to leave reviews both in the form of a star system and comments. I would advise you to keep an eye on these and respond to any negative feedback.  You can turn an unhappy customer into a happy customer, simply by the way you deal with their issues.

Note: I strongly advise against leaving reviews of your own venue under a different account. It's dishonest and looks desperate.

## Social Media
Social Media platforms could easily have several articles on them alone but for all the attention they are given, they are only one part of a complete online footprint.
I'm not saying social media isn't important; it is. But none of them build confidence in your brand as well as a polished website.
I am not going to provide advice on how to run your social media, but for ensuring your setup is complete, there are a few key steps to follow.

##### Facebook

Setting up a business account for your venue on Facebook will allow you to connect with your guests on a very personal level. Only use beautiful imagery that captures your brand identity and make sure all of your details are up to date.

##### Instagram

Set it up as a business account and pick a handle that is as simple and has your venue name in it (you'd think I wouldn't have to say that).
Instagram now gives you the option to add your phone number and email address and I recommend you add both.

## Local Venue Directories
Often overlooked, local directories are a great way to reach a broader audience who are specifically looking to find somewhere to eat or drink. These directories are usually free to have a listing (though they might hassle you to pay for advertising) and they do their own marketing. They also often target tourists which will help expand your client base.
The obvious ones in Australia are publications such as Concrete Playground, Broadsheet and Timeout but each state and even some cities have their own tourist sections full of restaurant listings.
Spend some time doing some research on your area and add your name to the list. It costs you nothing and can really help. Maximises your exposure.

Some of this might seem way too complicated and some of it might sound like overkill but if you get these 5 things right, you'll have a much better chance of bringing new customers to your door for years to come.

# How to Open A Bar (Online)

Opening a bar is one of the most exciting and terifying things a person can ever do. The dreaming and planning all the amazing things you're going to do, the incredible drinks program or the world-class menu. Anyone who has, wants to or is currently going through this process will understand just how overwhelming it can all get and it's often the case that a venue will overlook it's digital stratergy.

After all, you know how to make cocktails, serve the perfect steak or throw a hell of a party. Not build a website. That may be the case but there are certain things you can do without hiring a professional to drive customers to your venue and share your hard work with the world.
